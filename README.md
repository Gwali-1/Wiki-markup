# Wiki-markup

_A encyclopedia like application like wikipedia that allows you to add entries or articles with just markup language._
_Markup Language is taken and stored and upon request of the page, it is converted to equivalent html and displayed._

* The index page lists all entires or articles available as links which tunnel to the respective pages
* Has a search field to allow easy navigation to particular articles or entries
* Has a playful random link button on navbar that pulls out and displays a random article each time


*This is a simple implementation of the logic of taking in markup as input and providing html synthax to be diplayed in browser.This is no leveraging of a 
database.Entries submitted are saved as files in the "entries" directory which lives in the "encyclopedia" app of this djanfo project
